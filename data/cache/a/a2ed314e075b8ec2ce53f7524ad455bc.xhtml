Heroku is simple. Too bad it doesn&#039;t accept paypal.
You get ~500 free hours and a free postgres database.
Anyway, for go at least, it automatically detects it&#039;s a go build if there is a go.mod file included.
So the process boils down to:
</p>
<pre class="code">$ git init
$ git add *.go go.mod
$ git commit
$ heroku create
$ git push heroku master
 ... heroku builds &amp; deploys the go app</pre>

<p>
keep in mind your app should listen on the PORT env var.
