====== Hackbook: Macbook Pro laptop running Debian ======
I am not very happy with Debian, because it is so messy, too much things running in the background, systemd, dbus, a whole lot of background tasks i have no idea what they are doing and have no conscious recollection of installing.
Anyway, it runs pretty good on an old macbook which BSD didn't :-x

Some [[https://github.com/snhmibby/dotfiles|dotfiles are here on github]]

===== List of software I like =====

  * wmii; very simple tiling window manager
  * vim (see dotfiles above for plugin-list & vimrc)
  * Firefox, with  plugins:
    * vim-vixen
    * umatrix
    * ghostery
    * tree style tabs
