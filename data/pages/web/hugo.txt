====== Hugo Static Site Generator ======
[[http://gohugo.io|Hugo]] basically generates a website by stitching together [[Web:Template|templates]] and content files. It can also run external commands to generate other assets (e.g. CSS with SASS, transpiled javascript, web assembly).



===== Create a basic website in Hugo =====

Unfortunately, the Hugo documentation is a bit dense and it is not very clear how to get started. Most common tutorials and even the official documentation is of no help since they just suggest to install a theme and crank out content.

Fortunately, [[https://levelup.gitconnected.com/a-quick-tutorial-on-hugo-templates-creating-your-theme-a4102b42a85f|this tutorial]] starts from the ground up by creating a new theme and explaining how to get started with Hugo from basic building blocks.

Actually, searching on "hugo" and "create theme" brings up much more usefull tutorials than "create website" kind of queries
