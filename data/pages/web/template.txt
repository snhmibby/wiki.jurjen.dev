====== Templates ======

A template defines standard pieces of text and can have variables/loops/control flow to drive output. See e.g. [[https://pkg.go.dev/text/template]] for an example in the Go standard library.

Template systems or (more old-fashioned) add-hoc approaches using text tools (say, awk or the C-preprocessor) have been used. Many web servers have support for dynamic templates.

===== Static website generation =====
Uses template systems to create static website content.

  * Written in Ruby, which I don't know or understand or want to learn.

==== Hugo ====
[[https://gohugo.io|main site]], [[Web:Hugo|Hugo notes]]
