By far the better server OS when compared to Linux, or most Linux distributions.

The separation between system and installed packages and lack of nonsense make it far preferrable and easier to comprehend than a default linux installation. The amount of crappy background programs, configuration daemons and general crap running with a default Linux installation is plain uncomfortable. The Linux /etc tree reminds me of win32. Fuck that shit.
