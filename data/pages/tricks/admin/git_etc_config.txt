====== Put .configuration in a git repo ======

  - Create a folder for the git repo, initialize it
  - **hardlink** all configuration file into the repo. If they are hidden files, just rename them to a normal file.
  - Either automatically or manually push/pull the repo
  - Take care of restarting services (possibly needs scripts)
  - ...
  - ? Profit
  - Bonus points for recreating the directory layout from / the doing <code>git clone config.git</code>

All jokes aside, it's easy to <code>git add</code> any system file once you touch it and then the git repo shows a prettynice overview of what is important for you.
Difficult to keep 100% functional though. Better to use chef or ansible but any of those costs $$$ :-P
