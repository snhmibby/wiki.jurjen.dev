Heroku is simple. Too bad it doesn't accept paypal.
You get ~500 free hours and a free postgres database.
Anyway, for go at least, it automatically detects it's a go build if there is a go.mod file included.
So the process boils down to:
<code>
$ git init
$ git add *.go go.mod
$ git commit
$ heroku create
$ git push heroku master
 ... heroku builds & deploys the go app
</code>

keep in mind your app should listen on the PORT env var.
